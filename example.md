`This was a pretty unlucky start, and it doesn't look like we've gotten very far.`

`But with this information alone we've narrowed our possible answer set down from the starting ~2300 words to 10 words. `

The possible remaining words are :
- voice
- movie 
- biome 
- decoy 
- gecko 
- epoxy 
- dodge 
- booze 
- diode 
- evoke

Ideally, we would pick a word from the list that would either
<ol type="a">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
