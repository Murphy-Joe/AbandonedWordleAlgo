# Our first two guesses looked like this:

`This was a pretty unlucky start, and it doesn't look like we've gotten very far.`

`But with this information alone we've narrowed our possible answer set down from the starting ~2300 words to 10 words. `

## The possible remaining words are
||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|
| voice | movie | biome | decoy | gecko |
| epoxy | dodge | booze | diode | evoke |


`Ideally, we would pick a word from the list that would either`
1. Be correct
2. Narrow down the field to one other answer if incorrect

These words are also in order of which guesses will narrow the field the most.  If we choose "voice"

Had we chosen something like 'gecko' we would have got

So the takeaway is given a list of equally likely possibilities, your best guess will be the one that narrows down the field the most.  

*** The caveat that is still being worked out is when to use a word from the answer list (thereby giving a chance of being right) vs using a word from the playable list (thereby giving no chance of being right, but a much better chance of narrowing down the answer set the most)
