# Abandoned Wordle Algo

Had an idea for wordle. 
I thought I could combine the best 3-5 letters that would reduce your possible answer set to the smallest size.

Besides the mess I did not yet refactor, I ran into gotchas at a number of different points, but mostly how to adapt to a shrinking sample size. 

I went down a road of custom logic for different sample sizes that was completely unscientific and turned into tangly spaghetti asap. 

Tested as is, my human brain is smarter than this python script.  Which does not have the ego boosting effect you would hope.
